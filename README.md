Causal Dynamical Triangulations for quantum gravity in [Rust], built on fast Delaunay triangulation primitives.

## üåå Introduction

This library implements **Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)** in [Rust]. CDT is a non-perturbative approach to quantum gravity that constructs
discrete spacetime as triangulated manifolds with causal structure, providing a computational framework for studying quantum gravity phenomenology.

For an introduction to Causal Dynamical Triangulations, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0105267).

The library leverages high-performance [Delaunay triangulation] backends and provides a complete toolkit for CDT research and exploration.

## ‚ú® Features

- [x] 2D Causal Dynamical Triangulations with time-foliation
- [x] Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo simulation
- [x] Regge action calculation with configurable coupling constants
- [x] Ergodic moves (Alexander/Pachner moves) with causal constraints
- [x] Command-line interface for simulation workflows
- [x] Formal verification using [Kani] model checker
- [x] Comprehensive benchmarking and performance analysis
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## üöß Project Status

Early development - API and data structures may change. The library currently supports 2D CDT with plans for 3D and 4D extensions.

**Why Rust for CDT?**

- **Memory safety** for large-scale simulations
- **Zero-cost abstractions** for performance-critical geometry operations  
- **Formal verification** support via [Kani] for mathematical correctness
- **Rich ecosystem** for scientific computing and parallel processing

We welcome contributions! Here's a 30-second quickstart:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/acgetchell/causal-dynamical-triangulations.git
cd causal-dynamical-triangulations

# Traditional approach
cargo build && cargo test

# Modern approach (recommended) - install just command runner
cargo install just
just setup           # Complete environment setup (includes Kani)
just dev             # Quick development cycle: format, lint, test
just --list          # See all available development commands

# Run examples
just run-example     # Basic simulation

- `just ci` - Simulate CI pipeline locally (requires Kani)

## üìã Examples

### Library Usage

See [`examples/basic_cdt.rs`](examples/basic_cdt.rs) for a complete working example:

```rust
use causal_dynamical_triangulations::{
    CdtConfig, MetropolisConfig, ActionConfig, MetropolisAlgorithm,
    geometry::CdtTriangulation2D,
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create triangulation from random points
    let triangulation = CdtTriangulation2D::from_random_points(20, 1, 2)?;
    
    // Configure Monte Carlo simulation
    let metropolis_config = MetropolisConfig::new(1.0, 1000, 100, 10);
    let action_config = ActionConfig::default();
    let mut algorithm = MetropolisAlgorithm::new(metropolis_config, action_config);
    
    // Run simulation
    let results = algorithm.run(triangulation);
    
    println!("Acceptance rate: {:.3}", results.acceptance_rate());
    println!("Average action: {:.3}", results.average_action());
    Ok(())
}
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Build the binary
cargo build --release

# Run a basic simulation
./target/release/cdt --vertices 20 --timeslices 10 --steps 2000 --simulate

# Parameter sweep for phase transition studies
./target/release/cdt \
  --vertices 50 --timeslices 12 \
  --temperature 1.5 --coupling-0 0.8 \
  --steps 5000 --simulate
```

### Ready-to-Use Scripts

The `examples/scripts/` directory contains research workflows:

- **`basic_simulation.sh`** - Simple test run and validation
- **`parameter_sweep.sh`** - Temperature sweep for phase transition analysis  
- **`performance_test.sh`** - Performance benchmarking across system sizes

For detailed documentation, sample output, and usage instructions for each script, see [examples/scripts/README.md](examples/scripts/README.md).

For comprehensive CLI documentation and advanced usage patterns, see [`docs/CLI_EXAMPLES.md`](docs/CLI_EXAMPLES.md).

## üìã Benchmarking

Comprehensive performance benchmarks using [Criterion]:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
cargo bench

# Specific benchmark categories
cargo bench triangulation_creation
cargo bench metropolis_simulation
cargo bench action_calculations

# Performance regression testing
just perf-check          # Check for performance regressions
just perf-baseline       # Save performance baseline
just perf-report         # Generate detailed performance report
just perf-trends 7       # Analyze performance trends over 7 days
```

See [`benches/README.md`](benches/README.md) for benchmark details and
[`docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md) for comprehensive
performance testing workflow documentation.

## üîí Formal Verification

The library uses [Kani] model checker for formal verification of critical properties:

```bash
# Run all proofs (runs per harness matrix in CI on main and scheduled jobs)
just kani

# Fast verification (single critical harness, default on pull requests)
just kani-fast

# Individual harnesses
cargo kani --harness verify_action_config
cargo kani --harness verify_regge_action_properties
```

### Workflow behavior

- Pull requests run the fast harness set for quick feedback.
- Pushes to `main` (and manual dispatch) run every harness in parallel via GitHub Actions matrix jobs.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] Integrate an existing Rust **Delaunay** triangulation library (e.g., [`delaunay`](https://crates.io/crates/delaunay))
- [x] 2D Delaunay triangulation scaffold
- [x] Model‚Äëchecking with **[Kani](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/install-guide.html)** for core invariants
- [ ] 1+1 foliation (causal time‚Äëslicing)
- [ ] 2D ergodic moves (Alexander/Pachner moves with causal constraints)
- [ ] 2D Metropolis‚ÄìHastings
- [ ] Diffusion‚Äëaccelerated MCMC (exploration)
- [ ] Basic visualization hooks (export to common mesh formats)
- [ ] 3D Delaunay + 2+1 foliation + moves + M‚ÄìH
- [ ] 4D Delaunay + 3+1 foliation + moves + M‚ÄìH
- [ ] Mass initialization via **Constrained Delaunay** in 3D/4D
- [ ] Shortest paths & geodesic distance
- [ ] Curvature estimates / Einstein tensor (discrete Regge‚Äëlike observables)

## Design notes

- **Separation of concerns**: geometry primitives (Delaunay/Voronoi) are decoupled from CDT dynamics.
- **Foliation‚Äëaware data model**: explicit time labels; space‚Äëlike vs time‚Äëlike edges encoded in types.
- **Testing**: unit + property tests; Kani proofs for invariants (e.g., move reversibility, manifoldness).
