  and a Metropolis-Hastings simulation framework.

  It adds modules for:
  - Calculating the 2D Regge Action (`cdt/action.rs`).
  - Implementing ergodic moves like (2,2), (1,3), and edge flips
  (`cdt/ergodic_moves.rs`).
  - Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for Monte Carlo sampling
  (`cdt/metropolis.rs`).
  - Causal triangulation data structures (`triangulations/causal.rs`)
  - Basic command line argument handling via `clap`.

  simulation, simulation analysis, cache operations, and validation.
  Adds README to describe the benchmarking suite.

- **Changed: Improves test coverage and adds Kani proofs** [`16aae91`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/16aae91)

  Enhances the testing framework by adding a new testing guide,
  increasing test coverage, and introducing Kani proofs for action
  calculation properties. This ensures more robust and reliable
  code, especially in critical areas like the Regge action
  calculation. Also updates `.gitignore` and cspell to accommodate
  new test-related files and terms. (Internal change)

- **Changed: Refactors triangulation backend with trait-based geometry** [`c05f637`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/c05f637)

  Migrates triangulation to a trait-based geometry backend, providing
  better abstraction and testability by decoupling CDT algorithms
  from specific geometry implementations.

  This change includes:
  - Introduction of the `geometry` module with traits and backend implementations.
  - Restructuring of the `cdt` module to use the new trait-based backend.
  - Addition of Delaunay and Mock backend implementations.
  - Deprecation of the old `triangulations` module.

  No functional changes. Migration from legacy `CausalTriangulation`
  to new `CdtTriangulation` is recommended.

- **Changed: Refactors triangulation and simulation architecture** [`4d56e07`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/4d56e07)

  This commit significantly refactors the crate by separating
  geometric operations from physics constraints for improved
  layering and reusability. It introduces a smart wrapper for
  mutable TDS access with precise cache invalidation and enhances
  error context for triangulation generation. It also addresses
  an incomplete ergodic moves implementation, paving the way
  for a well-architected simulation. The changes include a new
  `moves.md` document detailing the new approach as well as
  integration tests.

- **Changed: Refactors Kani workflow and updates dependencies** [`aab33e2`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/aab33e2)

- **Trying out using Spade** [`8542cf4`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/8542cf4)

  Seems nice and featureful, but now having strange issues with Kani. And of course output is a whole 'nother thing.

  Commented out original source code in case I need to back out.

  CI Kani is going to fail.

- **Refactor Delaunay triangulation code** [`0564e2d`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/0564e2d)

  - Move `Point` and `Triangle` structs to a separate module
  - Make `Point` fields public
  - Make `Triangle::center()` method public
  - Make `bowyer_watson()` function public in the new module

  This commit refactors the code by moving the `Point` and `Triangle` structs to a separate module called "delaunay". It also makes the fields of the `Point`
  struct public and exposes the `Triangle::center()` method publicly. Additionally, it makes the `bowyer_watson()` function public in the new module. These
  changes improve code organization and allow for easier access to relevant functionality.

  - Added a step to use the "Swatinem/rust-cache" action in the "Codecov" workflow
  - Added a step to use the "Swatinem/rust-cache" action in the "Kani Rust Verifier" workflow
  - Added a step to use the "Swatinem/rust-cache" action in the "Install Rust toolchain" workflow

- **Refactor codecov.yml and lib.rs** [`b5464e3`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/b5464e3)

  - Remove version specification in codecov.yml
  - Comment out unused code in verification module

- **Refactor package and test names to use kebab-case** [`4447215`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/4447215)

  - Refactored the package name from "cdt_rs" to "cdt-rs" in Cargo.lock and Cargo.toml files.

- **First commit** [`9931dd3`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/9931dd3)

### Removed

- **Remove DCEL** [`45b2a17`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/45b2a17)

  We'll use our own Delaunay triangulation library instead. DCEL is only good for 2D Delaunay triangulations.

- **Refactor Codecov workflow and remove unnecessary code** [`2a6616a`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/2a6616a)

  - Refactored the name of the Codecov job in the `.github/workflows/codecov.yml` file to "Codecov via tarpaulin"
  - Removed commented out code that checked for dimensionality in `src/lib.rs`
  - Removed commented out code that defined a fixed set of points in `src/lib.rs`
  - Replaced `rand::prelude::*` with `rand::Rng` import in `src/utilities.rs`

  These changes improve readability and remove unused code.

### Fixed

- **Fixed: Handles exceptions when getting CPU info, Kani, CI hardening** [`da415a5`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/da415a5)

  Corrects exception handling in hardware utils to specifically
  catch subprocess errors and other related exceptions when
  retrieving CPU information. This prevents the script from
  crashing when it fails to gather CPU details.

  Better job of checking Kani versions.

  Better way of installing ActionLint for CI.

- **Fixed: Correctly identifies estimates files in criterion runs** [`83f9de0`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/83f9de0)

  Fixes an issue where the performance analyzer was not correctly
  identifying estimates files in criterion runs, specifically when
  located in the "new" directory.

  Updates the glob pattern to search for "estimates.json" in all
  directories and then filters to only include files under "new" or
  "base" directories. This ensures that the analyzer correctly
  parses the performance data from criterion benchmark results.

- **Fix changelog_utils and performance_analysis and update CHANGELOG.md** [`38162bd`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/38162bd)

  Summary:

  Implemented resilient project-root detection with upward search for Cargo.toml or .git and guarded trend-analysis regression against zero-denominator cases in
  main() and PerformanceAnalyzer.analyze_trends().
  Annotated the strict SemVer pattern with inline comments, extracted long-title handling helpers (_format_long_title(), _format_split_title()), consolidated
  ANSI color codes into module constants (COLOR_GREEN etc.), and made the repository URL fallback configurable via CHANGELOG_REPO_URL (_get_repository_url()).
  Ran just commit-check to execute formatting, linting, and the full Rust test suite; all checks and tests passed successfully.

  Also fixed spelling error propagated by auto-changelog

- **Pre-merge fixes** [`0f6ec5a`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/0f6ec5a)

  Added comprehensive docstrings to parse_args(), load_report(), coverage_entries(), filter_entries(), and main() in scripts/coverage_report.py. Optimized
  spell-check to gather diff output with POSIX-compatible read loops and ensured just commit-check succeeds. Simplified validate-toml to lint directly from the
  repository root. Precompiled changelog classification regex patterns in scripts/enhance_commits.py, enriched helper type hints, made unrecognized header
  handling explicit, and wrapped main() in robust I/O error handling. Strengthened simulation validation in CdtConfig::validate() to detect configurations where
  no measurements would be taken post-thermalization while documenting the existing tilde expansion limitation. Confirmed all checks pass by running just
  commit-check.

- **Fix config.rs and other script errors** [`916d103`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/916d103)

  Enhances the project's testing and performance infrastructure
  by updating dependencies, refining test scripts, and improving
  code coverage reporting.

  Specifically:
  - Updates the clippy-sarif and sarif-fmt installation to use
  `cargo install --locked` for more reproducible builds.
  - Adds more explicit dependency requirements in `just setup`.
  - Modifies coverage reporting to be more robust, and adds new
  coverage configuration.

- **Fixed: Validates config and handles CLI arg parsing errors** [`cde9605`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/cde9605)

  Fixes the CLI argument parsing and adds comprehensive config validation to ensure simulation parameters are within acceptable ranges.  This includes checks
  for positive measurement frequency, vertices count, and
  temperature. Catches `SystemExit` exceptions and returns corresponding
  error codes.

  Also updates auto-changelog config and benchmark names for clarity.
  The CI workflow is modified to target the `examples/scripts` directory
  for linting and formatting checks.

- **Fixed: Action linearity check overflow and Tds deprecation** [`803ab24`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/803ab24)

  Addresses potential integer overflows in the action linearity
  check by adding a pre-check. Now the linearity assertion is only
  performed if simplex counts are within safe bounds.

  Also, marks legacy Tds-based simulation code as deprecated,
  guiding users towards the trait-based backend API for better
  abstraction and maintainability. The legacy code remains for
  backward compatibility but its usage is discouraged.

- **Fixed: Validates Delaunay property in CDT triangulation** [`ebff8ac`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/ebff8ac)

  Validates the Delaunay property within the Constrained Delaunay
  Triangulation (CDT) implementation by leveraging the `is_delaunay`
  method in the Delaunay backend. This ensures that triangulations
  conform to the Delaunay criteria, improving the robustness and
  correctness of the triangulation process. Adds tests for Delaunay
  validation.
